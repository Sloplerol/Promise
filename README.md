# Concept
  A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. 
  It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. 
  This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, 
  the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
  
  
  
# Improvement
  * It seems like a upgrade on ES6 grammar
  * Promise could back from the rejected or resolved result to user, let us relized more clearly requests's success,besides take actions with it
  * An asynchronous operation encapsulated by a Promise was more efficiency



# What can this article bring you?
  * A simple encapsulation of a promise
  * High-level writing of promises
  * The usage of handle encapsulation async
  * Write Promise by hand to analyze the principle of source code cognition
  
  
  
# Ending
  * 📖 Promise has a long-term development prospect, I hope you can grasp it as soon as possible,It worthy learing about already
